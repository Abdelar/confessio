				There are thoughts and deeds that you might not be able to reveal to
				anyone, although sometimes you feel like your mind might explode or your
				chest might burst if you don’t. what if you could make your own
				confessions without revealing your identity?
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine yourself in a room, alone. you take a piece of paper and you
				start writing your deepest fears, your wildest fantasies, your craziest
				memories. no one to judge, no one physically there to criticize, just
				you and your confessions.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if you could say out loud what you’ve been keeping inside? what if
				you could say the whole truth and nothing but the truth? what if you
				could make your confessions to total strangers without having to fear
				their reactions? would you take the leap?
			</p>
			<p>
				An area that is your personal, anonymous, everyday diary. a place that
				is fully dedicated to your confessions, whether good or bad, shameful or
				embarrassing. just say it out loud. this is what the website is all
				about. a place to simply let it out…
